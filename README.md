Random tidbits of code and my ideas, for your perusal.

Hi everyone! I'm Daniel Zhao, a high school student with experience in app development, machine learning, and computational biology.

My language specialties are Python, Java, Javascript, and C++. If you think you have an opportunity that would be a good fit for me, please email me at dxczhao20@gmail.com.

This repo contains random tidbits of code and my ideas, for your perusal. I've included some math problems I worked out in C++ for USACO, a CS competition. There are also different models and image classifiers I've fiddled around with.

## List of projects

### Quantifying timbre with the Fourier transform
Apply Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to soundwaves to quantify and predict timbre. I have included a couple sound samples, but feel free to play around with your own .wav files. The classifier is not great when extended to more than 3 seconds of data (still working on that!).

### Pima Indian Diabetes
Binary classification of Pima Indian Diabetes data using multiple classifiers, including Linear SVM, adaboost, and neural network. Model accuracy is quite high, and I am interested in investigating feature importances.

### MNIST
Linear neural network that classifies MNIST handwritten digits. I experimented with Tensorflow and parameter optimization.

### Tolkien Generator
Using the Silmarillion as source text, I trained a tensor2tensor model based on the Transformer architecture from Google and generates paragraphs of text.
