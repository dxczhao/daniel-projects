# daniel-projects
Hi everyone! I'm Daniel, a high school student with experience in app development, machine learning, and computational biology.

My language specialties are Python, Java, Javascript, and C++. If you think you have an opportunity that would be a good fit for me, please email me at dxczhao20@gmail.com.

This repo contains random tidbits of code and my ideas, for your perusal. I've included some math problems I worked out in C++ for USACO, a CS competition. There are also different models and image classifiers I've fiddled around with.
